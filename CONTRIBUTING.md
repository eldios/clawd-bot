# Contributing to clawd-bot

Thanks for helping! A few ground rules keep this repo healthy.

## Dev setup

- Nix: `nix develop` gives you `esphome` and `esptool`.
- Otherwise: any ESPHome >= 2026.4.0 install works (`pipx install esphome`).
- `cp secrets.example.yaml secrets.yaml`, fill in WiFi and your
  `claude setup-token` output, then `esphome run clawd-bot.yaml`.

## Before opening a PR

1. `esphome config clawd-bot.yaml` must pass (schema validation).
2. `esphome compile clawd-bot.yaml` must pass.
3. If you touched UI or hardware bits, test on a real CoreS3 and say so in
   the PR ("tested on hardware: yes/no" plus what you exercised).

## Hardware facts need sources

Pin numbers, register values, and component options must come from a
canonical source - M5Stack's official ESPHome configs
(github.com/m5stack/esphome-yaml), the CoreS3 schematic, or the ESPHome
docs for the exact release. Link the source in the PR description.
"It worked for me" without a source is how ports rot.

## Style

- YAML: two-space indent, comments explain WHY, keep packages focused
  (hardware / poller / ui stay separate).
- Lambdas: keep them short; if C++ grows past a screenful it probably
  belongs in an external component.
- User-facing strings and docs are in English.

## Adding a board

The layout is built for it - one board = one entry file, reusing the
shared engine:

1. `packages/hardware-<name>.yaml` - display, touch (if any), power,
   buses. Source every pin from canonical references.
2. Pick a UI package matching the display class, or add one
   (`packages/ui-<W>x<H>-<class>.yaml`). The poller
   (`packages/usage-poller.yaml`) is board-agnostic - do not fork it.
3. `boards/<name>.yaml` - SoC/framework config + `packages:` include of
   common, hardware, poller, and the UI. Same substitutions contract as
   the CoreS3 entry (`claude_token`, `poll_interval`, `name`).
4. Add the board to the README table with its status ("tested on
   hardware" or "untested") and the import snippet.

UI packages must always show at minimum: the 5h utilization, a 7d
indicator, and the polling cost (req/day). Screens too small for the rest
should drop features, not shrink them into unreadability - that is the
whole point of this project.

## Releasing

1. Land everything on `main`, verify on hardware.
2. Signed tag: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z main -m "..."`.
3. Move the floating release branch: `git branch -f stable vX.Y.Z`.
4. Push tag and branch: `git push origin vX.Y.Z stable`.
5. Create the GitHub release: `gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes`.

Users on `ref: stable` pick the release up at their next Install; pinned
users bump their `ref:` when they choose to.
